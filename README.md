# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction System

A Python-based **Heart Disease Prediction System** built using **Logistic Regression** and a **Tkinter GUI**.  
The model is trained on the **Kaggle Heart Disease Dataset**, analyzing **13 key medical attributes** to predict the likelihood of heart disease.  
This project demonstrates how **machine learning + GUI** can be combined to make healthcare predictions accessible and interactive.

## 📌 Features

- Logistic Regression model for binary classification (Disease / No Disease).
- **Tkinter-based GUI** for user-friendly interaction.
- Uses **13 medical attributes** as input for prediction.
- Provides probability (%) of heart disease risk.
- Includes **Healthy** and **Disease** autofill examples.
- Displays model accuracy and allows verification with sample cases.
